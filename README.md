# AltiumLib

This is an attempt to make a lab unified Altium library

# Policy Remarks
* Make high quality footprints and schematic symbols.
* Make footprints generic and should use pin numbers as designators (to make it possible to reused for new components).
* Although multiple footprints options are preferable for a given schematic symbol, please make footprints "high-density", such that they consume the smallest amount of board realestate possible.
* Please link schematic symbols to their respective parts on Digikey / Mouser.
