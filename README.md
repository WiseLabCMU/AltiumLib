# AltiumLib

This is an attempt to make a lab unified Altium library

# Policy Remarks
* High quality footprints and schematic symbols
* Footprints are generic and use pin numbers as designators (to make it possible to reused for new components)
* Although multiple footprints options are preferable for a given schematic symbol, please make footprints "high-density", so that they consume the smallest amount of board realestate possible.
* Please link schematic symbols to their respective parts on Digikey / Mouser.
